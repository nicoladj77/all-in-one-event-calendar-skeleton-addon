Start by reading the summary and notes in the file\r\n[all-in-one-event-calendar-skeleton-addon.md](/all-in-one-event-calendar-skeleton-addon.md). Next\r\nspend some time browsing the PHP files. Each one has detailed comments\r\nthat will give you a good understanding of the code's purpose.\r\n\r\nPlease also pay particular attention to the structure of the\r\nfolders. This should be consistent across all add-ons, including\r\nyours. We structured our plugins following the\r\n[MVC architectural pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller). It\r\nhelps you create a clean structure. You should get a good sense of\r\nwhat it means from browsing these files.\r\n\r\nFeel free to leave comments with feedback, questions, or improvement\r\nideas you may have. We look forward to working with you on your\r\nadd-on!\r\n\r\nThe Timely Dev Team.\r\n\r\nSkeleton Addon functionality\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe All-in-One Event Calendar Skeleton Addon (or *Ai1ECSA* as we would\r\ncode-name it) allows you to select a message to be prepended to the\r\ntitle of selected events. Primary feature might be to display\r\nconsistent \"Sold Out\" message for all events. And be able to turn it's\r\ndisplay site-wide whenever you decide.\r\n\r\n### Settings\r\n\r\nFirst of all - there is a configuration section. It is created by\r\nusing features provided by\r\n[All-in-One Event Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/)\r\n(or *Core*, as we call it). Skeleton Addon specific settings are found\r\nin WordPress Dashboard, under *Events* -> *Settings* -> *Add-ons* ->\r\n*Skeleton*.\r\n\r\nOne setting is named `Message to add to sold out events:`. This is the\r\ntext value that will be prepended to selected events. It defaults to\r\n`Sold Out!`, but one may choose to use `GONE` or `LAST SEAT\r\nAVAILABLE` because it's just text.\r\n\r\nAnother setting is `Disable messages everywhere?`. If a user checks this\r\nthen the message will not be displayed anywhere.\r\n\r\nWe see these two types as most common setting elements, so we\r\nfeature them in the add-on. But you will find a description of other\r\ntypes in the PHP files,\r\n[for example here](/app/controller/ai1ecsa.md).\r\n\r\n### Events management\r\n\r\nWhen you activate the add-on it starts showing a checkbox with the\r\nlabel `Event is Sold Out` in post meta box. Post meta box appears for\r\nnew and existing posts on top right corner of the page, next to\r\n`Publish` button.\r\n\r\nThe user choice for this checkbox is stored in post meta. You will\r\nfind more about postmeta management in add-ons\r\n[here](/app/model/skeleton-soldout.md).\r\n\r\n### Displaying events\r\n\r\nIf user has selected the aforementioned checkbox for any of the\r\nevents - the value from the settings will be prepended, surrounded by\r\nsquare brackets, to the events title when event is being rendered on\r\nthe frontend.\r\n\r\nSo, if configured setting is `Sold Out!` and the event's title is\r\n`Tour of National History museum` and the checkbox is selected then in\r\nall views (Day, Month, Posterboard and others) including event details\r\npage it will be displayed as `[Sold Out!] Tour of National History\r\nmuseum`. That is unless second option in the settings is activated,\r\nwhich would disable that prefix.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
